# üìà Optimization Report: Bookings with User, Property, and Payment Details

---

## üîç Objective

Analyze and optimize the performance of a query that retrieves:

- All **bookings**
- Related **user** details
- Linked **property** info
- Associated **payment** records

---

## üßæ Initial Query

```sql
SELECT 
    b.*,
    u.*,
    p.*,
    pay.*
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN Users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
````

## üìä EXPLAIN ANALYZE Results

```text
Hash Join  (cost=52.73..79.29 rows=920 width=1956) (actual time=0.131..0.161 rows=22 loops=1)

  ->  Hash Join  (cost=40.70..64.80 rows=920 width=1126) (actual time=0.090..0.110 rows=22 loops=1)

              ->  Hash  (actual time=0.014 rows=27 loops=1)

  ->  Hash  (actual time=0.020 rows=22 loops=1)
        ->  Seq Scan on property p  (actual time=0.007..0.009 rows=22 loops=1)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Observations

* ‚úÖ **Hash Joins** were chosen (efficient for moderate-sized datasets).
* ‚ùå **Sequential Scans** were used on all joined tables.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Wide SELECT**: All columns fetched (`SELECT *`) ‚Äî increases memory use and I/O unnecessarily.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Optimized Query

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date,
    u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    p.name AS property_name, p.location,
    pay.amount, pay.payment_date
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN Users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

---

## üìå Justifications for Optimization

### ‚úÖ Reduced Columns

Fetching only the required fields avoids over-fetching large text columns (like `description`, `content`).

### ‚úÖ Verified Indexes

All join conditions and filtering fields are indexed:

* `idx_bookings_user_id`
* `idx_bookings_property_id`
* `payment_booking_id_key`
* `users_pkey`, `idx_users_email`
* `property_pkey`

### üß† Potential Future Improvements

* Add `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, or pagination for large-scale use.
* Use **materialized views** for complex joins.
* Partition the `Booking` table by `start_date`.
